Yo is a word deeply connected in the Philadelphia culture, therefore; no, it is not used only by ""little black kids"" or ""wannabe suburbans"" like the definitions before it has stated. 

A history lesson about the word's popular use in Philly from the New York Times: 
""In the 1930's a large proportion of the residents of South Philadelphia were Italian immigrants, mostly from the Campania region of southern Italy, the principal city of which is Naples.

In [the Neapolitan] dialect ""[guaglione]"" (pronounced guahl-YO-nay) signified a young man. The chiefly unlettered immigrants shortened that to guahl-YO, which they pronounced whal-YO. That was inevitably further shortened to yo. The common greeting among young Italian-American males was ""Hey, whal-YO!"", and then simply, ""Yo!"" And so it remains today.""

Sorry for this long post, but I had to [handle my business] about my city.

ha ha (laughter)   

""hi hi"" is the [Morse] equivalent of a laugh as in Morse  it sounds like someone chuckling (""hehhehhehheh hehheh"").  That is ditditditdit   [dit dit]  --- or [dot dot dot] dot    dot dot. You really have to listen to it sent in Morse to appreciate its laugh like sound. It is most commonly used in CW (Morse Code), but has carried over to voice as well. Many CW expressions have carried over to voice -- such as 73 ([Best Regards]) and 88 (love and Kisses), etc. The origin probably dates back before radio to [the telegraph] days. And since Hams used Morse long before voice became practical-- the sound of the Morse characters HI HI  was used to resemble a laugh sound. In some sense it is equivalent of a smiley. It's onomatopoeic  -- that is the naming of a thing or action by a vocal imitation of the sound associated with it (as buzz, hiss) The definitive answer might be found in the ""[Dodge's] [The Telegraph] Instructor Manual"" circa 1850 to 1900. However, I have never been able to find a copy of this document.
